# Introduction

## Context

## Objectives

Compare the baseline characteristics of patients undergoing ACL revision (ACLR) surgery whether or not they the LET technique was employed in the ACLR.

## Hypotheses

LET and no LET groups are comparable at baseline.

## Data reception and cleaning

In total there were 126 variables in the dataset received.
Variables in the raw data sheet were grouped into sections.
For this analysis only the baseline **demographic** characteristics and the variables in the **surgical data most recent revision ACLR** section were selected.

All variables in the analytical set were labeled according to the raw data provided and values were labeled according to the data dictionary for the preparation of production-quality results tables and figures.

After the cleaning process 12 variables were included in the analysis with 69 observations.
Table A1 shows the structure of the analytical dataset (section 8.3).
The data cleaning procedures employed are detailed in the analytical plan (**SAP-2021-004-TV-v01**).

# Methods

## Study Variables

### Primary and secondary outcomes

This analysis describes the epidemiological characteristics of surgical patients that undergone ACLR, and no endpoints were assessed.

### Covariates

The distribution of the characteristics were compared at baseline between the two study groups.
Variables to be considered for baseline comparison are:

- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Graft diameter
- Medial meniscus
- Lateral meniscus
- Cartilage

## Statistical analyses

The epidemiological profile of each study group (LET and no LET) were described at baseline.
Demographic and clinical variables were described as mean and standard deviation or as counts and proportions, as appropriate.
Distributions were summarized in tables and visualized in exploratory plots.

All comparisons were performed as univariate analyses.
Continuous variables were compared between groups with the independent t test with Welch correction.
Difference in distribution of categorical variables were assessed with the Fisher exact test.
No adjustment for covariates were performed.

All analyses were performed using the significance level of 5%.
All significance hypothesis tests and confidence intervals computed were two-tailed.

### Statistical packages

This analysis was performed using statistical software `R` version 4.1.1.

# Results

## Study population and follow up

A total of 69 patients that undergone ACLR surgery were included in the study, where the LET technique was used in 31 patients and 38 acted as a control.
Ages varied between 14 and 55 years, with an average age of 27 years with a SD of 10 years.
There were 28 (41%) male patients and 41 (59%) female.
Patients had BMI values ranging from 20.5 to 40 kg/m2 with average BMI of 26.8 kg/m2 and median 26 kg/m2.

Primary ACL surgeries recorded occurred between 1984-01-01 and 2017-08-30, and ACL revisions occurred between 2010-03-09 and 2019-05-31.
Per patient time between the primary ACL and the most recent ACLR ranged from 33 weeks to 27 years, with an average followup time of 6.57 years between primary and last revision surgeries, and median time of 4.08 years between primary and last revision surgeries.

The follow up of patients after ACLR ranged from 2 years to 10.3 years, with an average follow up of 4.18 years and median 3.08 years.

The distributions of these variables can be seen in Figures A1 -- A5 (Section 8.1).

The epidemiological profile of the typical patient that required ACLR surgery was a 27 years female with an average BMI of 26.8 kg/m2.


## Surgical characteristics and baseline comparison

Patients included in the study required grafts with diameters ranging from 7.5 to 11 mm.
Average graft diameter used was 9.6 mm with an SD of 0.7 mm.
Most patients did not require procedures in the medial meniscus (48%), the lateral meniscus (58%) or in the cartilage (96%).
A total of 13 patients (19%) had partial resection in the medial meniscus, indicating a possibility of arthrosis in the knee joint, and 12 (17%) had partial resection in the lateral meniscus.

Most of the characteristics evaluated in this study did not indicate significant differences when using the LET procedure compared to not using it (Table 1).
Demographic and clinical characteristics had comparable distributions for
sex (p =	0.228),
age (Cohen's D = 0.33, 95% CI = -0.16, 0.81, p =	0.179) and
BMI (Cohen's D = 0.13, 95% CI = -0.40, 0.67, p =	0.619).
Surgical characteristics also had comparable distributions for
graft diameter (Cohen's D = 0.05, 95% CI = -0.42, 0.53, p =	0.818),
medial meniscus (p = 0.684),
lateral meniscus (p = 0.569),
cartilage (p = 0.498) and
MTPS (Cohens' D = 0.03, 95% CI = -0.44, 0.51, p = 0.886).
Follow up time was significantly lower for patients that had ACLR using the LET technique
(Cohen's D = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.29, 1.3, p = 0.001).

All of the observed Cohen's D standardized mean differences (Cohen, 1988) range from very small (d = 0.04) to small (d = 0.32).
Note that the minimum effect size detectable by this study would be of a medium effect size (d = 0.68, see **SAP-2021-004-TV-v01**) or larger.

# Conclusions

The epidemiological profile of the typical patient that required ACLR surgery was a 27 years female with an average BMI of 26.8 kg/m2.

None of the characteristics evaluated in this study indicated significant differences when using the LET procedure compared to not using it.
Patients had comparable distributions for demographic characteristics such as 
sex (p = 0.334),
age (p = 0.187, d = 0.32) and
BMI (p = 0.462, d = 0.20),
as well as surgical characteristics such as
graft diameter (p = 0.877, d = 0.04),
medial meniscus (p = 0.582),
lateral meniscus (p = 0.521) and
cartilage (p = 0.496).

Therefore, LET and no LET groups are comparable at baseline.
